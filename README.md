# The Clean Kitchen Project

**Under development and open for radical changes.**

## Synopsis

This project is a small hobby project to see if we can figure out if someone is dumping (dirty) kitchen ware in the kitchen sink at work.

## Motivation

Normal people clean up after themselves. But lately the number of dirty slackers has been rising. Everyday the kitchen sink is filled to the brim with contaminated tableware. But alas, a brave project takes on the battle against these filthy animal. The Clean Kitchen project is the last attempt to create an effective deterrent against the rise of the bacteria spreaders.

The weaponry consists of arduino, piezo elements, raspberry pi, machine learning (scikit-learn / azure ml), python, scikit, cleaverness and smarts. Let the battle begin!
